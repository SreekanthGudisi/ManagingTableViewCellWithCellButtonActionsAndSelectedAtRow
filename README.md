# ManagingTableViewCellWithCellButtonActionsAndSelectedAtRow
Here most of TableViewCell problems I have solved, Like when clicking the cell button after scrolling the remaining rows may be changed and when selecting at **didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath** the row, after scrolling the remaining rows may be selected. So I created an app to solve those problems. Here adding GitHub code

1. In the first screen, Click on a red button and just scroll down you can't see other rows won't be changed automatically in UITableViewCell 
2. Clicking on **didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath** you can go another details screen that's the second screen, in that screen after selecting a row other rows won't be selected automatically in UITableViewCell.
