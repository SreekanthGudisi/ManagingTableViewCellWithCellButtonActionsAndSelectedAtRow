# ManagingTableViewCellWithCellButtonActionsAndSelectedAtRow
Here most of TableViewCell problems I have solved, Like when clicking the **cell button** after scrolling the remaining rows may be changed and when selecting at **didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath** the row, after scrolling the remaining rows may be selected. So I created an app to solve those problems. Here adding GitHub code

1. In the first screen, click on a red button and just scroll down you can't see other cells are affected automatically in UITableViewCell. 
2. Clicking on **didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath** in the first screen you can go to details screen that's the second screen, in that screen after selecting a row other rows won't be selected automatically in UITableViewCell.
