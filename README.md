# ManagingTableViewCellWithCellButtonActionsAndSelectedAtRow
Here most of TableViewCell problems I have solved, Like when clicking the **cell button** after scrolling the remaining rows may be selected and selecting at **didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath** the row after scrolling the remaining rows may be selected. So I created an app to solve those problems.

1. After running the app you can see in the first screen a red button, which is **cell button** with action. 
2. Clicking on **didSelectRowAt** you can go another details screen, in that screen after selecting a row other rows won't be selected automatically in UITableViewCell.
